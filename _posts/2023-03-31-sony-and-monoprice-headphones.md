# In which I talk about headphones I have

Headphones are important to me. Some of the reasons:

* I like listening to music (and I've been known to [create music](https://soundcloud.com/e51ffa9f) on occasion)
* I watch youtube videos
* Sometimes I make videos (which I post to my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@davehohacks)),
  and editing requires listening to the audio
* I'm on [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) quite a bit for office hours and meetings, and it's nice
  to be able to hear what people are saying

Bluetooth and I don't get along, so that means I use wired headphones exclusively.

So...this blog post is about wired headphones that I own, and what I think about
them.

Disclaimers:

* I'm not an audiophile
* Nothing I'm about to say is supported by any kind of experiments
  or empirical measurements

Having said that, I do find that there are significant qualitative differences
between headphones, and I have some opinions.

# The contenders

Here are the headphones that I own and that I have significant experience with:

1. [Sony MDR-ZX110](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/mdrzx110-blk)
2. [Sony MDR-ZX310](https://www.sony.com/lr/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-zx310-zx310ap)
3. [Monoprice 8323](https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=8323)
4. [Sony MDR-7502](https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/headphones/mdr-7502)
5. [Sony MDR-7506](https://pro.sony/ue_US/products/headphones/mdr-7506)
6. [Sony MDR-V4](https://www.head-fi.org/threads/sony-mdr-v4-cans-seeking-full-specs-and-other-owners-experiences.820493/)

Without further ado, here are my thoughts!

## Sony MDR-ZX110

So, these are super-cheap, but basically decent. It's not unknown for Best Buy to have
them for $10 or so.

Good points: Sound quality is acceptable. They're comfortable.
They fold up for compact storage.

Bad points: Even though they're nominally low impedance (around 25â„¦),
they're not very loud, and I find that I need to crank the volume fairly
high on my laptop to produce reasonable sound volume.

Conclusions: These are ok. Get yourself a
[case](https://www.amazon.com/MDRZX110NC-MDRZX110-MDRZX110AP-Headphones-Carrying/dp/B07GXJKP8T)
for them so that they're protected when you throw them in your laptop bag.

## Sony MDR-ZX310

To me, these sound exactly the same as the MDR-ZX110 headphones, and the form
factor is exactly the same. Their list price is slightly higher, but I routinely
find used ones in good condition for about $13 shipped on EBay. Importantly,
they come in colors, so they look cool. The blue ones are my favorite, but I
also have red ones (as you can see above.)

So, let's consider them as equivalent to the MDR-ZX110.

## Monoprice 8323

TODO: photo

I bought these a few years ago because I read reviews indicating that they
were the best-sounding headphones for less than $50. (At the time of writing,
you can get them for about $17.)

Good points: They do sound great.

Bad points: They're fairly heavy and somewhat uncomfortable for extended use.
Most significantly, the clamping pressure they exert makes wearing them
while also wearing glasses painful. This is a deal-breaker for me,
unfortunately.

Conclusions: If you don't wear glasses, these are worth a look.

## Sony MDR-7502

<center><a href="{{baseurl}}/img/mdr-7502.jpg"><img style="text-align: center; width: 640px;" src="{{baseurl}}/img/mdr-7502.jpg"></a></center>

These were the first decent set of headphones I ever owned. I now have two
pairs that I bought from
[B&amp;H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/802634338-USE/sony_mdr_7502_headphones.html)
and [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0002F74E8).

Good points: These might still be my overall favorite headphones for
sound quality. They're quite efficient, so no problem driving them from
a laptop or music player (unlike the MDR-ZX110s and MDR-ZX310s.) They're lightweight
and comfortable for extended use. They are "on-ear" rather than "over-ear",
which I generally prefer.

Bad points: They have a "Y"-type cable rather than a cable that feeds into
one ear cup only. The cable is quite long, arguably too long for most
of my  uses (where I am typically quite close to the device the headphones
are connected to.) Worst of all, any movement of the cable translates
into mechanically-induced sound, to a much greater degree than any other
headphones I've used. If you're standing or sitting still, it's not a huge
deal, but it is still a bit irritating.

Conclusions: These are worth considering if you're going to use them in
a context where you're not moving around much.  They've been discontinued
for a long time, but used ones aren't too hard to find. I wouldn't spend
more than $30 or so.

Note: the earpads on many Sony headphones degrade and eventually will need
to be replaced. The good news is that replacement pads are cheap, easy to find,
and easy to install. For the MDR-7502, I think that most 70mm ear pads
should work. I have used [these ones](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093D1THX9)
on a set of MDR-V4s, but they should work on the MDR-7502s as well.

## Sony MDR-7506

TODO: photo

Apparently these are widely used by professional audio engineers due to their
flat response across the range of audible frequencies.

Good points: Even though they're "over-ear" headphones, they're
lightweight and very comfortable for extended use, even while wearing
glasses.  Sound quality is (to my ears) excellent: detailed mids
and highs with with adequate bass.  They're also very repairable! Unless
you are replacing the drivers (which are not economical to source),
pretty much any other part could be serviced or replaced. They fold
to a fairly compact form for storage.  (I'd recommend getting a [hard
case](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0744CP6GV) if you're going to travel
with them.)

Bad points: The long, coiled cable is a bit annoying. The 3.5mm plug
on the pair I bought from EBay was damaged and didn't make a consistent
connection, so I replaced the cable with one that I adapted from
a 3.5mm aux cable, which makes them a lot easier to use with a
computer or audio device.

Conclusions: I like these. There are a couple things to note, however.
The ear pads degrade over time, but are easily replaceable. My research
also suggests that they are somewhat prone to having the drivers go bad,
either by failing outright, or by the low-end response degrading.
I was fortunate in that the ones I bought on EBay sound good.
Overall, I could see these being my main headphones.

See also: My impression is that the Sony MDR-V6 is basically the same
as the MDR-7506.

## Sony MDR-V4

TODO: photo

These are kind of a hybrid between the MDR-7502 and MDR-7506. Like the MDR-7502,
it's on-ear. Like the MDR-7506, they fold for compact storage, and the
cable attaches on one side only.

Good points: Sound quality is excellent. I like the over-ear form factor.
They fold up. They don't have the issue with the cable vibrations inducing
sound that the MDR-7502s have.

Bad points: They have coiled cable similar to the MDR-7506. On mine,
the cable is in good shape, so I don't mind it too much.

Note: The odds of you getting a pair with intact ear pads are
close to nonexistent. As mentioned above,
[these replacements](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093D1THX9) work
well.

Conclusions: I like these headphones! It seems that they're not
particularly well-regarded among headphone enthusiasts, and they're
still relatively easy to find used. (I bought mine on EBay for about
$25.)

See also: I think Sony MDR-V202 and MDR-7504 are similar or identical.

# The Verdict

I think the MDR-V4 are my favorites, followed closely by the MDR-7506.
Both have excellent sound quality and are comfortable.
