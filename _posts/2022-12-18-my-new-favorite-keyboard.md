# A mini keyboard that's actually good?

TL;DR the Cherry G84-4100 is a nice keyboard.

In the past few years I've become a convert to mechanical keyboards. I guess I
spend enough time typing in my day to day existence that a satisfying typing
experience is a significant quality of life improvement.  At work I'm currently
using a [Tesoro Gram MX ONE TS-G11UNL](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JG2J7T8),
a 104-key full size keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches.  It's a very nice
keyboard, and has served me quite well for more than 2 years. In my home
office, I've been using a cheap [Sunsonny mechanical keyboard](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JTLYHMG),
which is pretty good, although the Outemu brown switches
aren't as durable as the authentic Cherry MX switches, and I've had to replace
quite a few of them (which, to be fair, is easy to do.)

My home office is also my electronics lab, so the work surface gets used
for a variety of tasks, and a full-size (104 key) keyboard takes up quite a
bit of space. I've never used a mini keyboard as a daily driver, but I
was beginning to think that it might be worth considering. I happened
to watch the [Tech Tangents video on the "Happy Hacking" keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nk5V2Oewzuk)
(TL;DW the Happy Hacking keyboard sucks), and Shelby mentioned
the [Cherry G84-4100](https://cherryamericas.com/cherry-g84-4100-compact-keyboard.html)
as being a high-quality alternative. I found a good deal on EBay,
scoring two used ones for about $30 shipped.

Here is one of them (banana for scale):

Here are my impressions.

*It's small.* It's only about 27.5 cm wide, and the keys aren't quite full
size, so it does take a little bit of time to adjust to.  The spacebar
is not full width, and the backtick/tilde key is in an odd location to
the left of the spacebar.  There is no right control key.  However, the
most important keys are in the expected places, and it has function
keys (for me having Alt-F2 available to launch programs is a must.)
I was typing comfortably within an hour or so. The first day I used it,
I wrote about 1,000 lines of C++ code, and it was a pleasant experience.

*The key feel is spectacular.* In my opinion, this is a **very**
satisfying keyboard to type on. The keys don't require a ton of force to
actuate, but there's a satisfying "clunk" when you overcome the initial
resistance and the key bottoms out.

*It's quiet.* Despite having mechanical switches, it's reasonably quiet.
I don't think it's any louder than rubber-dome keyboards I've used, and it
might actually be quieter.

*It's well built.* My impression is that this keyboard is marketed for use in
point of sale systems, so I assume it's engineered to survive extended use.
It's fairly light, and the frame is plastic, but there's no flex or rattle
when typing, and it rests flat.

Anyway, if you are looking for a mini keyboard as a daily driver or just for
occasional use, the G84-4100 is worth checking out. If you're patient you should
be able to find them on EBay for $20 or less.
