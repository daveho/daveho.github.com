So I haven't posted anything on my blog for almost one year.
So, I thought an update, and a resolution to post stuff more
often, might be appropriate :-)

Here's what has been happening:

* I've reluctanctly shelved my mc68008 project: I fully intend to
  get it working at some point, but based on my available free time,
  that will probably be sometime around the year 2025
* I have been spending most of my free time working on [CloudCoder](http://cloudcoder.org),
  an open source programming exercise system inspired by [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com).
  CloudCoder has actually reached the point where it can be used in anger:
  we used it fairly extensively in our
  [most recent offering of CS 101](http://faculty.ycp.edu/~dhovemey/spring2013/cs101).
  It supports exercises written C/C++, Java, Python, and Ruby, and to date
  has been used at 6 colleges and universities (that I know of!), with
  one more coming online shortly.

More to come!
