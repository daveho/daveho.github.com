title: MC68008 Free Run

In the previous installment, I described the clock and reset circuit I'm
using for my MC68008 computer project.

In this post, I describe getting the CPU to execute instructions
for the first time.  Not *interesting* instructions, but instructions
nonetheless.  This is an important milestone; at the very least, it
shows that it is possible that the TS68008CP10 chip I'm using 
is working.  (I'll reserve final judgement until it executes some
instructions that I write.)

## What is a free run?

A *free run* is a circuit in which a CPU executes meaningless instructions.
In the case of the MC68008, the (single-byte) opcode 0 is the **nop** instruction, which
does nothing except incrementing the program counter by 1.  If we tie
all of the data bus lines to ground, the CPU will read all 0 bits each
time it fetches an instruction, and thus the CPU will do nothing but
execute **nop** instructions.  This sounds boring, except that by observing
the highest address line (**A19**), we can watch the CPU cycle through
the address space.  The **A19** line will change state every 524,288
instructions, as the program counter moves from the low 512K of
the address space to the high 512K.

## Free run circuit

I adapted the free run circuit from
[a nice project handout](http://courses.cs.tamu.edu/rgutier/ceg453_s00/prj2.pdf)
from a course at Texas A&M University.  I used my own clock and reset circuit,
but otherwise I followed the circuit described in the handout.
The idea is to tie various lines that control the CPU, such as
**-DTACK**, **-BR**, and **-BERR** to either ground or VCC as
appropriate.  For example, by tying **-DTACK** to ground we force
each bus cycle to end immediately, effectively running the CPU
without any wait states.

Rather than generating separate **-RESET** and **-HALT** signals
from the reset circuit, I feed a single **-RST** signal into
both the **-RESET** and **-HALT** pins on the CPU.  [I've read that
this is acceptable](http://patpend.net/technical/68000/68000faq.txt).
There are some situations in which it is
advantageous to separate **-RESET** and **-HALT** (such
as single-step execution), but in the interest of simplicity
I'm not worrying about those cases.

I followed the recommendation in the handout to feed the **A19** signal
to a gate in a 74HCT04 inverter.  (The handout actually suggested
a 74LS04, but I prefer CMOS parts.)  The output of the gate is then used
to turn an LED on and off.

Here's a picture of the circuit on the breadboard:

## It blinks! But not (seemingly) at the correct rate

Well, long story short, I wired it up and it seems to work.  The LED
blinks!

Is it working correctly?  The TS68008 datasheet seems to indicate
(in Table 7.15) that a **nop** instruction requires 8 cycles to execute.
With an 8 MHz system clock, that's an even 1,000,000 instructions per second.
There are 1,048,576 **nop** instructions in the address space,
meaning that it should take just a bit over 1 second for the CPU to
cycle through the entire address space.

*However*...in the actual circuit, the LED seems to be blinking
*twice* per second.  Could it be that a **nop** actually needs only
4 cycles to execute?  That seems unlikely, since a bus cycle alone
requires a minimum of 4 cycles.

Perhaps I'm not understanding something.  The **-RESET** signal
is remaining high (i.e., not asserted), so it doesn't appear that either the MAX1232 or the
CPU is generating spurious reset pulses.  As far as I can tell,
the duty cycle of the LED seems to be exactly 50%, which would
be the case if the CPU really is cycling through its address space.

## What next?

I would like to figure out what is going on.  Probably I will
ask my colleague [Greg Link](http://faculty.ycp.edu/~glink/) to
help me use a logic analyzer to see if the other address lines
are toggling in the expected pattern.  (Working at an
engineering school is sweet.) If they are, then I suppose
that it really is working correctly.  I may also try a different TS68008 chip
(I have 4 of them), and possibly a slower oscillator module
(although I don't have any on hand.)

Assuming I am satisfied that the free run is working, then the
next step will be to connect an EPROM and execute some actual code.
