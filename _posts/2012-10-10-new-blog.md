I'm moving my blog to github using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/).

Although I've already published [one website using Jekyll](http://cloudcoder.org),
I'm finding the initial site provided by Jekyll Bootstrap to be a bit complicated.

We'll see how it goes.
